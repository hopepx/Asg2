ZenHara is a clothing brand that specializes in creating comfortable and stylish pieces for everyday wear. Our focus is on using high-quality, sustainable materials to make clothes that are both good for the planet and good for you. We believe in a minimalist aesthetic and strive to create timeless, versatile pieces that can be worn in any setting. Whether you're running errands, hitting the gym, or going out with friends, ZenHara has the perfect outfit for you.
 
## Design Process
 
For the design process, it would have started with a thorough research on the target audience, the industry, and the competitors. This research would have been used to inform the design decisions and ensure that the website meets the needs and expectations of the users.

The target audience for the ZenHara website would have been individuals who prioritize comfort and style in their everyday clothing and who are conscious about the impact their clothing choices have on the environment. The website's goal would have been to provide these individuals with a user-friendly and visually appealing online destination where they can easily find and purchase sustainable and comfortable clothing.

To achieve this goal, the design process would have likely included the development of user stories such as:

As a conscious consumer, I want to easily identify sustainable materials used in the clothing, so that I can make informed purchasing decisions.

As a busy individual, I want to be able to quickly find outfits that are both comfortable and stylish, so that I can save time getting dressed in the morning.

As a customer, I want to be able to see multiple views of the clothing, including model shots, so that I can get a better understanding of how the clothing looks and fits.
Additionally, the design process would have also involved creating wireframes, mockups, and diagrams to guide the development of the website, which would have been tested and refined based on user feedback to ensure that the website is as user-friendly and effective as possible.
